      <description>Events are the core data construct provided by the eyeson library. Most interactions with the room will be processed through events. The identifying attribute of an event is its type. When listening for events the most common thing you want to do is to respond to an event, commonly distinguished by conditionals, a switch statement or a factory.
Note
eyeson js library will handle some additional events for you in order to provide a higher level abstraction and for ease of use you will not receive those events.</description>

      <description>A JavaScript library to easily connect to video meetings in modern browsers.
 Simple but powerful: All you need is an access key. The high level abstraction allows easy control of video and audio streams, chat, screen capturing, broadcasting, media integration, document presentation and hardware device handling. Lightweight: Besides offering a simple interface for managing complex workflows, eyeson has only few external dependencies. This keeps the size and potential compatibility risks small.</description>
