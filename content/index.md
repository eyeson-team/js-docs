The eyeson JavaScript library provides a well defined interface to communicate
with the eyeson room service API in order to fully control eyeson video
conference sessions.

Visit the [introduction](introduction/) section to see how you can start
your first own video conference with just a few lines of JavaScript.

The [overview](overview/) and [events](events/) sections guide you through
deeper constructs and usage, providing a reference on handling the full feature
set of an eyeson room.

To build an interface for controlling media interaction with audio and video we
provide several tools that can come in handy, like a sound meter that provides
current volume level of microphone input, a device manager, screen capture
session handler, and many others - to be found in the [utilities](utilities/)
section.

We use this library to run and extend [eyeson.team], as well as any
integrations. If you need any further information not to be found in the
documentation or you are not sure the eyeson services will fit your needs,
leave us a [message](mailto:developers@eyeson.team) or [GitHub issue], we're
always up for a challenge.
