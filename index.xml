Logger Collect and manage development, debug, and error messages in one place.
import { Logger } from &#39;eyeson&#39;; Logger.error(msg); // output error Logger.warn(msg); // output warning Logger.log(msg); // output log Logger.debug(msg); // output debug  Device Manager Manage audio and video device settings.

      <description>Events are the core data construct provided by the Eyeson library. Most interactions with the room will be processed through events. The identifying attribute of an event is its type. When listening for events the most common thing you want to do is to respond to an event, commonly distinguished by conditionals, a switch statement or a factory.
Note
Eyeson js library will handle some additional events for you in order to provide a higher level abstraction and for ease of use you will not receive those events.</description>
